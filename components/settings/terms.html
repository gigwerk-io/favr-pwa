        1. Introduction
        This Privacy Policy describes how FAVR, Inc. will gather, use, and maintain your personal information. It will also explain your legal rights to control our use of that information.
        By using the FAVR Platform, you confirm that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service (together referred to herein as the “Agreement”). The Agreement governs the use of the FAVR Platform. FAVR will gather, use, and maintain information consistent with the Agreement.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. General Terms
        In this Privacy Policy:
        FAVR, Inc. may be referred to as "FAVR," “we,” “our,” or “us.”
        We call a user of the FAVR Platform a “User,” or collectively, the “Users.”
        "You" and "your" refer to an individual User of the FAVR Platform.
        The community platform that we offer at our website (askfavr.com) is referred to as the “Site.”
        The platform and related services provided by FAVR, the Site and mobile applications (whether on iOS or Android), including without limitation information provided by FAVR to potential and actual Users in relation to the services, together are called the “FAVR Platform.”
        “Terms of Service” refers to our terms, which can be found at https://askfavr.com/favr-pwa/components/settings/terms.html. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Terms of Service.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Users Outside Of The U.S.
        <br>
        3(a) Important Information for Users Outside of the U.S. – Transfer of Data
        We primarily store data about you, including personal information, on servers located and operated within the United States. If you reside or are located outside of the U.S., we may send and store your personal information (also commonly referred to as personal data) to the U.S. in order to provide and operate the FAVR Platform. By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge the transfer to and processing of your personal information on servers located in the U.S. and other countries. If your personal information is transferred from the European economic area to FAVR located in the U.S., please see the EU-US Privacy Shield section below. Our collection and use of the personal information of U.S. Users in accordance with the U.S. laws related to privacy and use of personal data and information, including what is determined to be “personal data and/or information,” are different and may be less protective than those afforded to EU Users under the GDPR.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Information Received By FAVR
        Personal Information FAVR collects certain information such as your name, address, approximate geographic location of your computer or mobile device, telephone number, email address and bank account and other Financial Information if you voluntarily choose to share such information with FAVR. We do require that you furnish this information when you register with us as a Tasker or a Client, because we need the information in order to provide the FAVR Platform. When you register your account, and through communications transmitted through our Site and your use of the FAVR mobile application, we collect information including your name, address, phone number and email address. You also may choose to send FAVR personal information in an email message containing inquiries about the FAVR Platform. Certain offerings of the FAVR Platform, such as newsletters, surveys, contests, and the like are optional and so you are not required to enter them or to give us your data in connection with them. Where you do choose to enter them, we will use your data to operate and manage the survey, contest or similar in connection with our legitimate interest in promoting our business and the FAVR Platform.
        Cookies and Other Technologies. When you visit websites on the Internet, your browser may automatically transmit information to the websites you visit throughout every visit, including ours. In a similar way, when you use our mobile applications, we will access and use mobile device IDs to recognise your device. Like many websites, we use “cookies” and equivalent techniques through our mobile applications to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk.
        We utilize persistent cookies that only FAVR can read and use, and access mobile device IDs:
        to save your login information for future logins to the FAVR Platform;
        to assist in processing items during checkout;
        to hold session information; and
        to track user preferences.
        We utilize session ID cookies and similar technologies:
        to enable certain features of the FAVR Platform;
        to better understand how you interact with the Site and the FAVR Platform;
        to monitor usage by our Users and web traffic routing on the FAVR Platform;
        to track the number of entries in FAVR promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and
        to identify visited areas of the FAVR Platform.
        Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the FAVR Platform and then close your browser.
        Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser, and we may use Flash cookies (or local shared objects) to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Site to personalize your visit.
        You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the FAVR Platform.
        We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with the FAVR Platform and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns, and to compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. We also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag” which triggers a cookie to collect information about your visits to the Site and to other websites, and they may use that information and share and combine it with other information with their partners to show you advertisements for goods and services you might be interested in on the Site and on other websites and apps, including by observing the kinds of products and subject-matter you are interested in and certain demographic information about you.
        Device Information. When you visit and interact with the FAVR Platform or the Site, FAVR may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of computer or mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your operating system, the type of Internet browser(s) you use, and information about the way you use the FAVR Platform (“Device Information”). We may use Device Information to monitor the regions from which Users navigate the Site or the FAVR Platform and for security and fraud prevention purposes. Tools with the goal of anonymizing certain Device Information (like the TOR network) are forbidden on the FAVR Platform. While we respect your right to hide this information, we believe that doing so is in conflict with the spirit of our platform and our desire to host an open and honest marketplace. Use of such tools hampers the functionalities of the FAVR Platform.
        Identity Verification. We may collect personal information, such as your date of birth, taxpayer identification number, and address, to validate your identity or conduct background checks (“Identity Information”).
        Financial Information. To help Taskers set up a payment account and help Clients make payments to Taskers and pay fees, we may collect financial information, including name, address, credit card number, bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information (“Financial Information”).
        Location Information. When you visit the FAVR Platform via a mobile application, we use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to determine the city you are located in and display a location map to improve service for our Users. We will not share your current location obtained in this manner with other Users. If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile application.
        Third Party Information. If you registered through a co-branded version of our FAVR Platform through one of our Partners (as defined below), they may provide us with basic information such as your name, address, and purchase history related to your Task needs. Additionally, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, payment information, or fraud detection information, from third party Agents (as defined below) and combine it with other information that we have about you. Finally, FAVR works with third party Agents to perform identity checks and criminal background checks on Taskers, and we receive information from them such as publicly available information about your criminal history.
        Public Areas. Your profile on the FAVR Platform consists of information about you, and may include personal information, photographs, work history, skills, hourly pay rates, feedback/rating information, and other information, including your username (“Profile”). The information in your Profile may be visible to all Users and the general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your Profile. If you choose to post a Task via the FAVR Platform, the contents of such listing will be publicly viewable.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. FAVR's Use of Personal Information
        FAVR uses Personal Information (including Identity Information and Financial Information) for the following purposes:
        To operate and make available the FAVR Platform. We use your data to connect you with other Users in order to enable the posting of, completion of, and payment for Tasks;
        For billing and fraud prevention, on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring a safe and secure environment in which Clients and Taskers can meet and conduct business;
        To conduct identification, authentication, and background checks on Users, in order to advance our legitimate interests in ensuring the safety of our Users;
        To analyze Site usage as necessary for our legitimate interest in improving the FAVR Platform to grow our business;
        To contact you and deliver (via email, SMS, push notifications, or otherwise) administrative notices, marketing notifications, offers and communications relevant to your use of the FAVR Platform as necessary for our legitimate interests in proper communication and engagement with our Users and in promoting our business;
        To provide you with customer support in order to fulfill our contracts with Users;
        For internal market research, troubleshooting problems, and detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity for our legitimate interests in ensuring a safe and secure environment in which Users can meet;
        To assist Users in the resolution of complaints and disputes between them, as necessary for our legitimate interests in facilitating good relations among Users;
        To enforce our Terms of Service in our legitimate interests in ensuring our rights are complied with; and,
        As otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
        Advertising. Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and FAVR believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. FAVR may use cookies and other technologies and personal information to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them. In addition to banner ads, FAVR may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide. Your choices regarding third party ads are set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out section below. Advertising and marketing is carried out as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.
        Analytics and Market Research. FAVR may analyze your information and web navigational data based on your interests, and may use the analysis from this information in a way that doesn’t reveal a name, email address or other "real-world" identity (“Market Analysis”) in order to market the FAVR Platform, improve the likelihood of a sale to a group of potential Users, and increase the likelihood that a group's experience with the FAVR Platform is relevant to its interests as a whole, as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.
        FAVR uses information to sell services to Users who express an interest in these services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from our Market Analysis. We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.
        Google Analytics: we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service. Google Analytics uses cookies to help FAVR analyze how visitors use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site and the FAVR Platform (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for Site operators, and providing Site operators with other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Site and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
        Cell Phone Numbers. FAVR may use your cell phone number to call or send recurring text messages to you, using an autodialer or prerecorded voice, in order to provide you notifications about Tasks, for marketing purposes (with your consent where required by law), and to administer the FAVR Platform. If you would like more information about our policy, or to opt out, please review below or Section 8 of our Terms of Service, or visit https://support.FAVR.com. You may be liable for standard SMS and per-minute charges by your mobile carrier. FAVR may also message you via “Push” messaging, which you can opt-out of on your mobile device. Data rates may apply.
        Financial Information. We use Financial Information solely as authorized by you in order to operate the FAVR Platform and, in particular, to ensure that Taskers are paid by Clients. We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing our platform and services. To keep your financial data secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers. We have contracted with a third party to process your payment card information.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. With Whom Does FAVR Share Information?
        We only share the information we collect about you as described in this Privacy Policy or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:
        Third Party Agents. To operate the FAVR Platform, including processing your transactions, we may share your information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers (“Agents”) so they can provide us with support services as follows:
        Email origination,
        Identity/background check requirements in relation to Taskers (currently carried out by our providers Onfido and Sterling);
        Fraud detection (currently carried out by our provide Smyte);
        Receipt or support services,
        Customer relationship management services,
        Financial transaction fulfillment (in which we are currently supported by Stripe who process your information in accordance with their own privacy policy here: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy); and
        To otherwise help us provide the FAVR Platform, including all of the things described in the preceding section.
        Third Party Partners. Some FAVR content is "sponsored by" or "presented by" other companies. If you connect to the FAVR Platform through a co-branded version of our FAVR Platform through one of our third party service partners (“Partners”), or otherwise participate in one of our partner programs with such a Partner, we may share information about your use of the FAVR Platform with that Partner in order to offer the integrated platform and to measure how the partnership performs. We may share your information with our Partners in order to receive additional information about you. We may also share your information with Partners to create offers that may be of interest to you. Please check such Partner’s privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don't want these Partners to have your personal information, you can choose to not participate.
        Other Users. FAVR facilitates contact between Clients and Taskers and reserves the right to share a Tasker’s contact information (e.g. phone number, or email and postal address) with a Client and vice versa, or with their legal or other representative, in order to facilitate the resolution of a dispute related to or arising from an interaction between two or more Users of the platform. This exchange of information is a mandatory part of the FAVR Platform.
        Legal Obligations FAVR may disclose personal information or User Generated Content, including location data or communication data, to a third party if required to do so by law or pursuant to a court order, warrant or subpoena. FAVR reserves the right to disclose personal information from both private and public areas of the Site and the FAVR Platform in the absence of a court order warrant or subpoena if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or FAVR or its partners, parents or affiliates.
        It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).
        Business Affiliates Finally, FAVR reserves the right to transfer, sell and/or distribute all information collected through the FAVR Platform to an affiliate, subsidiary, or third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets or stock. We will require the new entity to follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, as and to the extent required by applicable law.
        <br>
        <br>
        7. Choice/Opt-Out

        During registration you choose whether to receive marketing correspondence from either FAVR or its partners and whether you want to participate in a variety of FAVR programs.

After logging on, click on the “Account” tab, then select “Notifications” to make your selections. We may occasionally contact you with information about special events, sales, activities, promotions, contests, submission opportunities and programs.

        You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from FAVR sent via text message at any time by following the instructions provided in those messages to text the word, "STOP". Please note that your opt-out is limited to the phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, FAVR may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or FAVR’s ongoing business relations.
        If you receive unsolicited email from a FAVR domain, please contact us at https://support.askfavr.com.
        <br>
        <br>
        8. FAVR's Information Retention Policy
        We retain personal data for for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations. We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.
        Your rights
        You have the right under certain circumstances:
        to be provided with a copy of your personal information held by us;
        to request the rectification or erasure of your personal information held by us;
        to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information (while we verify or investigate your concerns with this information, for example);
        to object to the further processing of your personal information, including the right to object to marketing as mentioned in the Choice/Opt-Out section above; and
        to request that your provided personal data be provided to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
        Where the processing of your personal information by us is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent without detriment at any time. You can also change your marketing preferences at any time as described in the Choice/ Opt-Out section above.
        <br>
        <br>
        9. User Generated Content
        Taskers who have provided FAVR with any videotape, film, record, photograph, voice, or all related instrumental, musical, or other sound effects, hereby consent to our use of these materials as User Generated Content in accordance with Section 9 of the Terms of Service.
        <br>
        <br>
        10. FAVR’s Security of Collected Information
        Your FAVR account is password-protected so that only you and authorized FAVR staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your FAVR account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.
        FAVR takes reasonable precautions to ensure that your information is secure on its system by backing up data in separate backup drives and using public key access encryption and firewalls on both our main and backup servers. FAVR has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security, and making sure that every FAVR employee is aware of our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, FAVR cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. While FAVR will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other Personal Information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all Personal Information and/or Financial Information stored therein, and you agree to hold FAVR harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. If you have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Service.
        FAVR expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to the FAVR Platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        11. How Can Users Update Their Information?
        You can update your Personal Information at any time by logging in and clicking on the “Account” tab. There you can view, update and correct your account information.
        So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 (UK) or 21 (US) are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages.
        Our databases automatically update any Personal Information you edit in your profile. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remains in our databases and becomes the property of FAVR upon submission.
        <br>
        <br>
        12. Notification of Changes
        FAVR's Privacy Policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy might change as FAVR updates and expands the FAVR Platform. FAVR will endeavor to notify you of any material changes by email. FAVR also encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. If you do not understand any of the terms or conditions of any of FAVR's policies, feel free to contact us at https://support.askfavr.com.
        <br>
        <br>
        13. Children’s Privacy and Note to Parents and Guardians
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. The FAVR Platform is not directed to children under the age of 13 and children under 13 are not permitted to use the FAVR Platform. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete or disable such information. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please let us know at https://support.askfavr.com.
        <br>
        <br>
        14. Contacting Us?
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of the Site, your dealings with the FAVR Platform, or if you have technical problems, you may contact us at https://support.askfavr.com.
